#  Project Collaboration Guidelines
Welcome to the shared repository for our projects! Please follow the instructions below carefully to ensure smooth collaboration and prevent conflicts with other team members.

#  1. Clone the Repository
Before starting, clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
          . git clone https://github.com/your-repo-url.git
Navigate into the repository:

bash
Copy code
          . cd your-repo-name
# 2. Create Your Personal Branch
Always work on your own branch to avoid interfering with others. Create a branch with the following format:
feature/your-name-project

Example:

bash
Copy code
          . git checkout -b feature/john-portfolio
Push your new branch to the remote repository:

bash
Copy code
          git push -u origin feature/john-portfolio
# 3. Work Within Your Assigned Folder
Each team member has a designated folder for their project. Locate your folder and only make changes inside it:

          Copy code
          root/
          â”œâ”€â”€ john-portfolio/
          â”œâ”€â”€ jane-portfolio/
          â””â”€â”€ other-folders/
Add Your Project Files:
Place all your files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, assets, etc.) inside your folder.
Do not edit or modify files in folders assigned to other members.
# 4. Regularly Commit Your Changes
Make frequent commits to save your progress. Use descriptive commit messages to indicate the changes made.

Example:

bash
Copy code
           . git add .
           . git commit -m "Added my portfolio"
# 5. Pull Updates from the Main Branch
To keep your branch up to date with the latest changes in the repository, regularly pull updates from the main branch.

bash
Copy code
         . git pull origin main
Resolve any merge conflicts that might arise, if necessary.

# 6. Push Your Changes
Once youâ€™ve committed your changes, push them to your personal branch:

bash
Copy code
          . git push origin feature/your-name-project
