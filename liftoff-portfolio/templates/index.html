        <h2>About Me</h2>
    
        <div class="profile-paragraph">
            <p>I am a junior aerospace engineering student with a strong interest in UAV design, aerodynamics, and software development. 
                My work combines technical expertise and creative problem-solving as I build advanced solutions to real-world problems. 
                With experience using SolidWorks for rocket and UAV design, I mix theoretical knowledge with practical implementations to bring creative ideas to reality.
            </p>

            <p>I'm also looking into the integration of AI and aerospace, creating smart algorithms and systems for predictive analysis and data-driven decision-making. 
                My current initiatives involve applying machine learning to drone-based commercial solutions for urban logistics and agroforestry and forecast admissions.
            </p>
            
            <p>My technical toolset consists of Python, Jupyter, JAVA, and Flutter, which I optimize for performance. I enjoy developing interactive apps, such as equation-solving websites,
                and actively participate in open-source projects such as OpenRocket. In addition, I hope to make greater contributions to the tech and aerospace sectors in the coming 
                5-10 years, both locally and globally.
            
            </p>

            <p>With a focus on continual learning and collaboration, I hope to pursue graduate studies. I hope to advance my career in jobs that value innovation 	
                and make significant contributions to aeronautical and mechanical engineering. My ultimate goal is to bridge technological gaps and promote innovation in the aerospace 
                industry.
